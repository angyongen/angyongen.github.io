## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

I would use [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/angyongen/angyongen.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content.
Normally, whenever you commit to GitHub Pages repositories, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages from the content in your Markdown files. However, this repository index.html, I do not think Jekyll is being used here.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/angyongen/angyongen.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
